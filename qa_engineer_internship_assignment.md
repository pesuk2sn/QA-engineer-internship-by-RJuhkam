# Summary

DataFlash is an intuitive web application to get information about user entries. The application user can get all the information needed if an XLSX database file is downloaded. Although users can receive needed entries, filtering them in a web application is a hassle. Some fundamental issues are in the user database. The issues and probable fixes are brought out as a list.

__Application__:  
- Filters are not working properly. Unclosable drop-down menus make using the application a hassle. Drop-down menus should require users to make a choice. If no choice is made, the user should be able to close the menu by clicking on the empty space, for example. Some filter choices don't reflect in the database results (the age and gender filters, for example).   
- Wrong results if filters are not applied. The application should give all the entries when filters are not applied, just like in the table file, which can be downloaded.  
- Default values should be added to filters that can take two inputs. It's useful when the user wants to enter only one input.  
- Adding a button to untick all 'select columns to display' checkboxes.  
- fixing JS errors that are brought out in the test report.

__Database__:  
- Database uses the 'age' attribute. Because age changes dynamically, it's not really useful to add it as an entry attribute.  
- using 1-way hashing for entry passwords. Base64 encoding is easily reversible and therefore unsecure.  
- Finding the reason the database contains empty entries.  
- Preventing identical entries/usernames/user_ids in the database.  
- Fixing relations between country codes, cities, and countries.  
- Changing the email attribute so the value is required in there.  
- Fixing character encoding in the first and last name columns.
